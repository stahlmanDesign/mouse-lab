#general facts

- ~90 cages
- things change over time in cages, such as
	- where is the male in each breeding cage on a certain date
	- need to know when litters are
		- born
		- about to be born
	- time to ween
	- time for experiments
	- if weened, a new cage is started, with a new ID. these new mice need to be genotyped

#tabs

- male rotation
	- row for each date (usually once a week when male moved)
	- where male moved (or is now)
	- was litter born? (and gets new ID for that cage. L1 is relative to cage. DOB is presumed by looking at age of mice)

	- need place to put note when male moved, ie fought with females previous week
